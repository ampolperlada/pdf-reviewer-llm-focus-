/*generateEmbedding(text)
  → Takes: "JavaScript is cool"
  → Returns: [0.234, -0.567, 0.123, ...] (768 numbers)
```

**Why?** So we can compare meanings mathematically!

**Example:**
```
"I love dogs" → [0.2, -0.5, 0.8, ...]
"I like cats" → [0.21, -0.48, 0.79, ...] (similar numbers!)
"The sky is blue" → [0.9, 0.3, -0.6, ...] (very different!)*/
